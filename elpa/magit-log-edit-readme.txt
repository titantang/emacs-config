A major mode for editing Git commit messages.

This is the mode that was used before Magit switched to using the
external `git-commit-mode'.  That still has some problems, though:

Well, actually only one is left:

- Doesn't work well with tramp.
  https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/801

Both issues will be addressed, but for some people these issues are
deal breakers, and so I have this old package available again.

If you are not actually bothered much by these issue (or did not
even notice until you read this) then DO NOT install this package.
It also has its limitiations, which in least in my eyes are much
worse.
